<h4 align="center">üí∞ Expense Splitting üí∞</h4>

> NOTE: This project was 100% vive coded. It was built to meet our own needs for a feature-rich, user-friendly open source expense splitting app. It works reliably for us and we use it daily, but we do not plan to refactor it. It fulfills its intended purpose as-is.

Kostos is a web application designed to help groups manage and split expenses collaboratively within projects.

Track who paid what, categorize expenses, manage payment methods, easily calculate who owes whom based on flexible splitting rules, and see project stats to understand how you are spending.

## üöÄ Self Hosting

1. Get the docker compose file

   ```bash
   wget -O docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shynewt/kostos/refs/heads/main/compose.yaml
   ```

2. Run

   ```
   # The sqlite file must exist before running
   touch kostos.db && docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd kostos
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**

   - Initialize the database schema (if starting fresh):

     ```bash
     npm run db:push
     ```

   - Alternatively, run existing migrations:

     ```bash
     npm run db:migrate
     ```

   - (Optional) Seed initial data if needed (check `scripts/init-db.js`):

     ```bash
     npm run db:init
     ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üìú Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server (requires `build` first).
- `npm run lint`: Runs Next.js's built-in linter.
- `npm run db:generate`: Generates SQL migration files based on schema changes using Drizzle Kit.
- `npm run db:push`: Pushes schema changes directly to the database (useful for development, potentially destructive).
- `npm run db:studio`: Opens Drizzle Studio, a GUI for interacting with the database.
- `npm run db:init`: Runs a script to potentially initialize/seed the database (see `scripts/init-db.js`).
- `npm run db:migrate`: Runs database migration scripts (see `scripts/run-migrations.js`).

## üíæ Database

This project uses Drizzle ORM to manage the SQLite database schema and queries.

- **Schema:** Defined in `db/schema.ts`.
- **Migrations:** Managed by Drizzle Kit. Generate new migrations using `npm run db:generate` after changing the schema. Apply migrations using `npm run db:migrate` (or potentially `db:push` during development).

## üê≥ Docker

A `Dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` are provided for building and running the application using Docker containers. Refer to these files for details on the container setup.
