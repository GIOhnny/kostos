<h4 align="center">üí∞ Expense Splitting üí∞</h4>

> NOTE: This project was 100% vive coded. It was built to meet our own needs for a feature-rich, user-friendly open source expense splitting app. It works reliably for us and we use it daily, but we do not plan to refactor it. It fulfills its intended purpose as-is.

Kostos makes it easy for groups to track, manage, and split expenses together. No user registration is required. A simple interface with powerful features designed for effortless collaboration.

## üöÄ Self Hosting

1. Get the docker compose file

   ```bash
   wget -O docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shynewt/kostos/refs/heads/main/compose.yaml
   ```

2. Run

   ```
   # The sqlite file must exist before running
   touch kostos.db && docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd kostos
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**

   - Initialize the database schema (if starting fresh):

     ```bash
     npm run db:push
     ```

   - Alternatively, run existing migrations:

     ```bash
     npm run db:migrate
     ```

   - (Optional) Seed initial data if needed (check `scripts/init-db.js`):

     ```bash
     npm run db:init
     ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üìú Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server (requires `build` first).
- `npm run lint`: Runs Next.js's built-in linter.
- `npm run db:generate`: Generates SQL migration files based on schema changes using Drizzle Kit.
- `npm run db:push`: Pushes schema changes directly to the database (useful for development, potentially destructive).
- `npm run db:studio`: Opens Drizzle Studio, a GUI for interacting with the database.
- `npm run db:init`: Runs a script to potentially initialize/seed the database (see `scripts/init-db.js`).
- `npm run db:migrate`: Runs database migration scripts (see `scripts/run-migrations.js`).

## üíæ Database

This project uses Drizzle ORM to manage the SQLite database schema and queries.

- **Schema:** Defined in `db/schema.ts`.
- **Migrations:** Managed by Drizzle Kit. Generate new migrations using `npm run db:generate` after changing the schema. Apply migrations using `npm run db:migrate` (or potentially `db:push` during development).
